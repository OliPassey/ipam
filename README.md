# ipam
 Personal use IPAM project that is probably of no-use to anyone. Also learning I do not like JavaScript.

 ## Description
 A simple MongoDB backed, JS webapp to keep track of IP usage in your network. It is currently just a data-entry tool, it does no scanning or importing. 
 I am playing with importing NMAP output or retrieving DHCP information from PFSense but I promise nothing, ultimately I need a list of IPs in use and got a bit carried away. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

 ## Installation
 Docker
```bash
olipassey/ipam
```
 
## Usage
Once running hit http://ip:3000/  
http://ip:3000/networks is available for noting Networks or Subnets by CIDR range, these can be colour coded for quick reference.  
You'll also need to create a .env file in the root of the file system replacing MONGODBIP with the IP of your MongoDB instance.  
```bash
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://MONGODBIP:27017/ipam
PORT=3000
```

Imagine white text in an excel grid with all the text centred up nicely. Totally great...
